## TOPIC 1.  ATOMIC DESIGN

This is an article with a simple introduction to Atomic Design [link](https://paulonteri.com/thoughts/atomic-design-react).
In the article you'll see links to other sources of documentation and insights on Atomic Design.

## THOUGHTS

The web was initially very page by page focused, you made requests to a backend that served you HTML pages rendered by the browser.
With the move to more Frontend Frameworks where your content was available client side and adapted to responses from external sources (apis, browsers, etc).
The need for a more modern architecture for structuring applications was created and Atomic Design was implemented.

It works closely to the principle of Chemistry.
Atoms build up Molecules, Molecules build up Components, Components build up templates and templates build up pages.
We won't be as verbose or granular, we will work witk components & containers (while collating the UI in Next.js' pages structure).

The advantage of Atomic Design is it's ease of understand and easy maintenance, hopefully it shouldn't take too much time to get used to.

We won't be writing any code for now, our next step will be looking into the template and configuring it to fit you better.
but for now, please look through the documentation available in the link above and leave your thoughts, advantages and possible
approach to Atomic Design.

Figma atomic components is a methodology for building pattern libraries that makes it easier to build websites.
Components are divided into several categories like:
Atoms
Molecules
Organism  
Templates and
Pages

Atomic design also make it easier to be consistent on all the components on the website. For example creating consistent buttons that matches throughout the website.  while maintaining the flexibility of adjusting elements without spending too much time. It is like OOP with a twist.

## TOPIC 2.  TOOLING

Tooling is more related to the functionalities of your code editor.
It helps you with linting, formatting (and even making your codebase prettier, the extension is literally called Prettier).
I'll leave a list a extensions you should install on your vs code and leave a line for me briefly explaining what this extensions help you with.

1. ESLint
2. Import Cost
3. markdownlint
4. Prettier
5. Todo Tree
6. vscode-styled-components
7. React Extension Pack
